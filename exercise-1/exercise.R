# Exercise 1: Lists

# 1. Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast

  breakfast = c("pizza", "tea", "apple")

# 2. Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch

  lunch = c("pizza")

## 3. Create a list "meals" that has contains your `breakfast` and `lunch`
## Ensure the components of your list are named accordingly
  
  meals = list()
  meals$breakfast = breakfast
  meals$lunch = lunch
  
## 4. Add a "dinner" element to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner.
## you may use assignment with dollar or double brackets.

  meals$dinner = c("soup", "brocoli", "beef")
  
# 5. Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'

  dinner = c(meals$dinner)

# 6. Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list

  lunch = c(meals[[2]])
  
# 7. Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early.meals`

  early.meals = meals[1:2]

### Bonus ###
# 8. Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use a loop or the `sappy()` function


# 9. Write a function that adds pizza to every meal


# 10. Add pizza to every meal!
